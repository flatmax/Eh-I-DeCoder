## What is Eh-I-DeCoder?

Eh-I-DeCoder is a streamlined AI coding assistant that brings together the power of Git, Aider, and a user-friendly web interface. It's designed for a world where software is no longer just "coded," but "decoded."

**"Eh Â¿ De Coder"**  
*"What the **** just happened here?"*

---

## Architecture

This application has two core components:

- **Python Backend**: A JSON-RPC-OO server that acts as the intelligent interface with Aider
- **Web Frontend**: A user-friendly web application for seamless interaction with your AI coding assistant

---

## Requirements

### Backend
- Python 3.8+ (Currently developed and tested with v3.12)
- Aider and its dependencies (automatically installed)

### Frontend
- npm

---

## Setup

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the python directory and install the package:
```Bash
cd python
pip install -e .
```
This command installs: Aider and all its required dependencies
The aider-server console script

#### Troubleshooting
If you encounter a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'boto3', simply install the missing dependency:
```Bash
pip install boto3
```
### Frontend Setup
Navigate to the webapp directory and install its dependencies:

```Bash
cd webapp
npm install
```

## Running the Application
To get Eh-I-DeCoder up and running, you'll need to start both the backend and frontend components.

1. Start the Backend Server
Once installed, use the aider-server console script (All arguments passed to aider-server are directly forwarded to Aider, allowing you to leverage any Aider configuration options.):
```Bash
# Start with default settings (port 8999)
aider-server

# Specify a different port for the JSON-RPC server
aider-server --port 8080

# Pass any Aider arguments (model, API keys, etc.)
aider-server --model deepseek --api-key deepseek=<your-key-here>
aider-server --model gpt-4 --api-key openai=<your-key-here>
aider-server --model claude-3-sonnet --api-key anthropic=<your-key-here>

# Combine server port with Aider arguments
aider-server --port 8080 --model gpt-4 --api-key openai=<your-key-here>
```
Alternatively, you can run the script directly:
```Bash
# Navigate to the python directory
cd python

# Start the JSON-RPC server
python ./aider_server.py
```
2. Start the Frontend
In a new terminal, navigate to the webapp directory and start the development server:
```Bash
cd webapp
npm start
```
Your web application will then be accessible at the URL shown in your terminal (typically http://localhost:8000).
